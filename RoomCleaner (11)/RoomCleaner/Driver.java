	 * This section of code gets info from the user in the following order: 1. Ask the user
	 * which world file they wish to process. Right now, that world file name is
	 * hardcoded in. 2. Ask the user for the starting location and direction of the
	 * Robot. A new Robot should be constructed and assigned to the global
	 * (instance) variable named roomba that is declared on line 10.
	 * 
	 * An inelegant way to interact with the user is via the console, using
	 * System.out.println and a Scanner that scans System.in (input from the
	 * console). A more elegant way to get user input might include using a
	 * JOptionPane.
